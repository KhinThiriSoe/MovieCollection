### This app is for Final project Stage 1 of ["Developing Android Apps"](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853) course from [Udacity](www.udacity.com).

### The app contains the following features:

- grid arrangement of movie posters
- sort order via a setting
- sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
- transition to a details screen with additional information

### What I've learned after the app :

- AsynTask
- custom adapter
- Picasso library
