# MovieCollection

The app is the Final project Stage 1 of Developing Android Apps course from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud853/l-4353948561/m-4328734595).
 
 App includes:
  - grid arrangement of movie posters
  - sort order via a setting
  - sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
  - transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
    - original title
    - movie poster image thumbnail
    - movie overview
    - user rating 
    - release date
    
What I've learned after this app :
  -  AsynTask
  - custom adapter
  - Picasso library
