# MovieCollection

 Final project Stage 1 of Developing Android Apps course from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud853/l-4353948561/m-4328734595).
 
 App includes:
  - grid arrangement of movie posters
  - sort order via a setting
  - sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
  - transition to a details screen with additional information
    
What I've learned after the app :
  - AsynTask
  - custom adapter
  - Picasso library
